10,FIVE,"Amazing coffee and amazing staff, with dairy-free options available. The coffee shop has a great chilled-out vibe too. Some lovely cakes and treats available too with a fair few options for those with dietary requests/allergies. Conveniently located over the road from Northfields Station too (and directly next to the Ealing-bound E2/E3 bus stop), so there really is no excuse to skip this place if you're after decent coffee.

Update 13/03/2020: The shop continues to go from strength to strength. One year since opening and the range of fresh food and coffee has greatly expanded and Nat and Louis have done great things with the shop, such as opening a little stand selling curated items, coffee, CBD products and small gifts. Nothing has changed in terms of the relaxed and friendly atmosphere, and I hope this place stays a good while yet.",2020-03-13T15:48:24.418Z
