Lovely place to relax and have a coffee. They really know their stuff when it comes to coffee and the food delicacies have really been thought about. Makes a change from the large coffee chains full of laptops and generic food, this is where you find quality coffee with a nice environment to relax!

An exquisite place to go for coffee. The staff are very friendly and chatty, and the coffee and food are each top-notch. Coffee is also made quickly but also to perfection; ideal if you have limited time. I would recommend their chocolate brownies in particular; they are unlike anything else I have ever tasted.

I loved the Pathfinder blend coffee, and the cheese and salami were very tasty.  I'd recommend this as a good place for a lazy Saturday to drink a coffee and people watch.
